## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where creativity meets engineering excellence!

- 🔭 I’m currently building **next-gen web experiences** using **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and exploring the synergy between **AI** and **frontend development**.  
- 🌱 As an engineering enthusiast, I’m diving deep into **AI integrations**, **IoT systems**, and **hardware-software interfaces**.  
- 🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on projects that blend **cutting-edge AI algorithms** with **intuitive frontend designs** or involve innovative **coding solutions**.  
- 💬 Ask me about **UI/UX design**, **AI-driven interfaces**, or **electronics prototyping**—I’d love to share insights and learn from you!  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I bridge the gap between **frontend finesse** and **hardware precision**—one line of code and one circuit at a time.  

Let’s innovate together! 🚀
